Linear Algebra :
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Linear Algebra is an important branch of mathematics which is very much useful in the field of machine learning.We being humans ,are capable of visualising 2D and 3D data.But in recent world,data is present in thousands of dimensions.we can't visualise that but we need to handle it.There comes the use of concepts of linear algebra.

They act as a bridge for applying our knowledge on 2D data(points) ----> nD data(points).

1D----> Point/vector
2D----> Matrix
nD----> Tensor

It comes as part of  the implementation of various concepts of ML models,So having decent knowledge of linear algebra is essential to become a data scientist.

These are the wonderful resources that I got while searching in the Internet  :

KEY POINTS in Linear Algebra :
* Distance of a point(a1,a2,....,an) from origin
* Distance between two points
* a.b = aTb = ai*bi for all i's
* theta = cos^-1((a1b1+a2b2)/(sqrt(a1^2+b1^2)*sqrt(a2^2+b2^2)))
* If a is perpendicular to b,a.b = 0
* Projection of a on b is d = ||a|| cos(theta)
* d = (a.b)/(||b||)
* w0+wTX = 0 is the equation of the plane
* ith dimension intercept is -b/wi
* A plane separates the space into two regions one is above the plane and another one is below the plane,those regions are called  "HALF SPACES".
